Base-Frank1 is a combination of all the code. All the code are belong to us.

using the quickest way to move some files from one repository to another. 

Set up a folder transfer
drag and drop. 


sit rep: 






Mechanics:


using codespaces sometimes on local machine windows. both repos are mine.

Hardest problem would be the 3d visual flying game…

See other repos…

Is it worth it to do 3d? Simulate 3D? Eg doom


Use svg or canvas? 

What does canvas use? Line segments? Curves? Just refactor for different outputs.

git add .
git commit -m "Add file from other repo"
git push

To run a minimal Astro site, you need:

astro.config.mjs (already present)
package.json (lists dependencies and scripts)
At least one page, e.g. src/pages/index.astro
A public folder for static assets (optional, usually public/)
Node modules (installed via npm install or pnpm install)
If you want to run the site now, make sure you have:

package.json in your project root
src/pages/index.astro (or another page in src/pages/)
Run npm install to install dependencies

npm install bulma

astro (core framework, already in your package.json)
@astrojs/react (for React integration, already in your package.json)
astro-navbar (for your custom navbar, already in your package.json)
bulma (for CSS framework, just added)
Any other UI/component libraries you use (e.g., three.js, d3.js if you add 3D/2D visualizations)
Optionally: sass or postcss if you use advanced CSS features
To check for missing dependencies, look for any import errors in your code or terminal output. If you plan to use additional features (SVG, canvas, etc.), 


For Astro projects, Markdown (.md) files should go in:

put file in pages: each Markdown file to become a page (e.g., /about.md becomes /about).
src/content/ or src/collections/ if you use Astro Content Collections for structured content (recommended for blogs, docs, etc.).
public only if you want the files to be downloadable/static assets, not rendered as pages.
For most use cases (blog posts, docs, etc.), use src/content/ or src/collections/ with Astro Content Collections. For simple standalone pages, use pages.

Automatic Link List: Use Astro’s Content Collections or glob imports to generate a list of pages or docs automatically.
For Markdown in src/content/ or src/collections/, you can loop through all entries and render links.
For pages in pages, you can use a glob import to list all .md or .astro files and generate links.
Example (automatic list for content collection):


This way, new docs/pages  are automatically added to the list.
