Mechanics:


using codespaces sometimes on local machine windows. both repos are mine.

Hardest problem would be the 3d visual flying game…

See other repos…

Is it worth it to do 3d? Simulate 3D? Eg doom


Use svg or canvas?

git add .
git commit -m "Add file from other repo"
git push

To run a minimal Astro site, you need:

astro.config.mjs (already present)
package.json (lists dependencies and scripts)
At least one page, e.g. src/pages/index.astro
A public folder for static assets (optional, usually public/)
Node modules (installed via npm install or pnpm install)
If you want to run the site now, make sure you have:

package.json in your project root
src/pages/index.astro (or another page in src/pages/)
Run npm install to install dependencies
