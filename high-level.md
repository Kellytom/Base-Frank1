For an amateur, at a high level, there is no one way to implement all the things to make a polished or smooth experience for the user in one language or framework or database or storage.

Some codebases are well suited to making and playing games, like canvas and webgl. Javascript is used but completely different libraries than for vector graphic creation or text creation or reading.

Large files are stored and retrieved in different ways depending on the situation. Binary files are used in many cases, but also base64 and json. Axios might be more for text, but another solution for server created graphics downloaded to the browser.

In general github and convex and javascript might be used in almost every project, but they are not the main elements. Any investment of time beyond learning the basics,   learning for example react, or next js, or  the github api, or the convex api, or javascript, might quickly be wasted. AI could cover all those details just as well.

Your assessment that Next.js is a strong option for handling large amounts of data, such as in an RPG game or for server-rendered graphics, is largely correct. Here are several reasons why Next.js could be particularly advantageous for such applications:
1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Next.js excels in server-side rendering, which allows for the generation of HTML on the server before sending it to the client. This is beneficial for games that require quick loading times and efficient rendering of graphics or data, as it can significantly reduce the time it takes for users to see content on their screens.
2. Streaming Capabilities
Next.js supports streaming responses, which means that data can be sent to the client in chunks rather than all at once. This is particularly useful for applications that need to deliver large amounts of data, such as game assets or real-time updates, as it allows users to start interacting with parts of the application while other data is still loading.
3. Efficient Data Fetching
Next.js provides various data fetching strategies, including static generation and incremental static regeneration (ISR). These methods can optimize how data is loaded and displayed, which is crucial for performance in data-heavy applications like games.
4. Performance Optimization
Next.js is designed with performance in mind, offering features like automatic code splitting and optimized loading of JavaScript and CSS. This can help ensure that your game runs smoothly, even when handling complex graphics or large datasets.
5. Scalability
Next.js applications can scale effectively, making it suitable for games that may experience varying levels of traffic. The framework's architecture allows for efficient handling of multiple requests, which is essential for multiplayer or online games where many users interact simultaneously.
6. Developer Experience
Next.js simplifies many aspects of development, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing complex configurations. This can lead to faster development cycles and easier maintenance of game applications.
Conclusion
While Next.js is a powerful framework for building web applications, including games, it is essential to consider the specific requirements of your project. If your game relies heavily on real-time interactions or requires very low latency, you might also want to explore other technologies or frameworks that specialize in real-time data handling, such as WebSockets or dedicated game engines. However, for many web-based RPGs and graphics-rendered applications, Next.js offers a robust solution that balances performance, scalability, and developer efficiency.
